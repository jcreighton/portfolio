			<h1>New York City</h1>
			<h2>&amp; the Grid</h2>
			<p>The street grid is a defining element of Manhattan, the city’s first great civic enterprise, and a vision of brazen ambition. It is also a milestone in the history of city planning and sets a standard to think just as boldly about New York’s future. This book and the related exhibition at the Museum of the City of New York honor the bicentennial of the Commissioners’ Plan of 1811 —the city’s foundational act of planning and a key to its identity.
		  </p>
			<p>In 1811, New York was a dynamic but still small city concentrated south of Canal Street, yet the commissioners boldly projected its extension to the heights of Harlem across 155 undeveloped streets. In the nineteenth century the grid grew horizontally, moving up the island. In the twentieth century it grew vertically, with skyscraper extrusions. The grid was a living framework, which enabled the city to grow and evolve over time; the grid itself also changed but without compromising its essential character.
			</p>
			<p>The crooked streets of lower Manhattan remind us that the grid was not the natural or pre-ordained condition of the city. The grid was designed and required vigilant enforcement to secure its uninterrupted, straight streets and avenues. 
			</p>
			<p>In 1848, after only forty years, the grid’s original surveyor, John Randel, Jr., noted how attitudes to the grid had changed. “This magnificent plan, which is now the pride and boast of this city, was at that early day opposed (like all other great improvements) as being visionary.”

		<article id="grid-proposal">
			<p>
			In 1811, the city’s planners, including Gouverneur Morris, Simeon De Witt and John Rutherfurd, proposed a grid stretching northward from roughly Houston Street to 155th Street in Harlem.
			</p>
		</article>
		<article id="grid-155th" class="section">
			<p>The 1811 commissioners who laid out the grid had assumed that it would take several centuries for urban growth to stretch beyond 155th Street. In actuality, it took 60 years for the grid to arrive at 155th Street.</p>
		</article>
		<article id="grid-even">	
			<p>The grid is not made up of evenly spaced, similarly sized blocks.</p>
		</article>
		<article id="grid-northsouth">
			<p>The blocks, which are all 200 feet wide (north to south), vary in length (east to west) from less than 250 feet to more than 900 feet.</p>
		</article>
		<article id="grid-eastwest">
			<p>Most east-west streets are 60 feet wide. However, seventeen of them are 100 feet wide. Most, but not all north-south avenues are 100 feet wide.</p>
		</article>
		<article id="grid-madlex" class="section">
			<p>Madison and Lexington Avenues (each 80 feet wide) were introduced after the 1811 plan to accommodate additional traffic.</p>
		</article>
		<article id="grid-park-ave">
			<p>In the 1840s Park Avenue consisted of squatter homes; in the 1860s breweries and factories dominated what was then 4th Avenue.</p>
		</article>
		<article id="grid-parks">
			<p>There were no parks or plazas included in the original plan but it was flexible enough to later accommodate Central Park.
			</p>
		</article>
		<article id="grid-broadway" class="section">
			<p>Broadway’s diagonal path across six north-south streets made room for public spaces like Union Square, Madison Square, Times Square and Columbus Circle.
			</p>
		</article>
		<article id="grid-plan">
			<p>New York’s grid plan was to first to eliminate named streets altogether (the names came later).</p>
		</article>
		<article id="grid-geometry">
			<p>The rationality behind Manhattan’s street numbering system—Cartesian analytical geometry—also underpins early modern conceptions of space more generally.
			</p>
		</article>
		<article id="grid-disorienting" class="section">
			<p>To early visitors, the grid was disorienting; the streets looked alike and offered no landmarks or mnemonic devices to distinguish one from the next.</p>
		</article>
		<article id="grid-value">
			<p>In 1807, the assessed value of New York City real estate was $25 million. In 1887 the assessed value reached $1.255 billion.</p>
